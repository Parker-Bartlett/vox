# <%= @project.module_name %>: a Vox site

This project was created by the [Vox](https://github.com/geolessel/vox) generator (`mix vox.new`).
A very basic site was created for you to modify as you see fit.

Full documentation can be found at [hexdocs.pm/vox](https://hexdocs.pm/vox).

After fetching dependencies (`mix deps.get`), generate the site with `mix vox.build`.
You can run a live-reloading dev server with `mix vox.dev`.

For more options for both of those tasks, run `mix help`.
